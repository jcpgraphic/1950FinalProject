<h2>expectations & reminders</h2>
<p>This course is about Web Development. This means you should conduct yourself as Web Developers!</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means you should understand the following:</p>
<strong>FTP</strong>
<p>If you don't understand FTP (File Transfer Protocol) right now, that's ok. After week 2 - don't ask me. This is a <strong>required</strong> skill<p>
<strong>File/Folder Names</strong>
<p>While it is technically possible, my recommendation is that you do NOT use capital letters, and I <strong>require</strong> that you do NOT use spaces in your file 
or folder names. Special Characters (those characters over the numbers on your keyboard) just won't work.</p>
<strong>Web Space</strong>
<p>The student web space is: students.thenet.ca/(student_name)
Notice that there is no www at the front</p>
<strong>Upkeep</strong>
<p>Each week, you should have your course web space (we'll set up the course web site later) up to date with assignments, exercises, etc.</p>
<strong>Navigation</strong>
<p>Please try to make things as easy to find as possible</p>
